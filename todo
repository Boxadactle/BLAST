- [TODO] Add gunpowder block: submitted to gravity and instantly explodes when catching or near fire
- [TODO] Added explosive barrel: instantly explodes when catching or near fire and can contain a variable amount of gunpowder for a variable explosion strength
- [TODO] Oriented barrels with an obsidian block directly placed on the opposite direction they're facing will have an oriented explosion, handy for strip mining!
- [TODO] Added coal dust: instantly catches on fire when near one
- [TODO] Using shears on a Creeper will yield 1-3 gunpowder along with having an 80% chance of disarming them, making them harmless (the other 20% is an instant explosion, so be careful!)
