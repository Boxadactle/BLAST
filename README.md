# Blast

**Blast** is a Minecraft Fabric mod that allows you to scratch that itch to blow everything up. It adds multiple throwable bombs for different situations. Blast bombs will drop all lootable blocks and do not destroy dropped items; these items however are submitted to the bomb shockwaves (meaning items can go flying if you throw too many bombs into a single spot).

# Items

## Bomb

The simplest and most classic of all bombs this mod has to offer, just to casually blow holes or expedite the mining process.

- Combining (shapelessly) gunpowder, an iron ingot and a piece of string will grant 4 of them.
- Fuse time of 2 seconds.
- Explosion power of 3.
- Will be defused and drop as an item if inside water.

## Golden Bomb

The bomb of those who wish to become rich as the dwarves of old.

- Combining (shapelessly) gunpowder, a gold ingot and a piece of string will grant 4 of them.
- Fuse time of 2 seconds.
- Explosion power of 3.
- Will be defused and drop as an item if inside water.
- All destroyed blocks are dropped affected by Fortune 3.

## Diamond Bomb

An unstoppable explosive with devastating shrapnel that pierce through most materials.

- Combining (shapelessly) gunpowder, a diamond and a piece of string will grant 4 of them.
- Fuse time of 2 seconds.
- Explosion power of 3.
- Will be defused and drop as an item if inside water.

A contact trigger explosive that can lay waste on the ocean floors.

- Combining (shapelessly) gunpowder, a prismarine shard and redstone will grant 4 of them.

A directional explosive that simplifies... well, strip-mining.
